                        One to comply with upcoming PSD2 regulation. PSD2 is designed to help end users gain control
                        over
                        their data, forcing businesses to open up access to one another. Using the Open Banking Standard
                        we
                        have implemented services that allow Capital One customers to grant consent to third parties so
                        that
                        they may securely share their account data with other financial organisations such as Yolt, a
                        money
                        management app. Recently took ownership of the Credit Limit Increase platform (CLIP) where we
                        have worked to improve the stability and maintainability of the service. CLIP would frequently
                        have
                        outages under load and our work has delivered a better experience for our customers and

                        Initially worked on a redevelopment project for Public Health England, a system that allows
                        direct
                        and secure retrieval of lab results for doctors. We took the decision to redevelop given the age
                        of
                        the
                        previous system and the lack of maintainability. Following the successful completion of the
                        project
                        for Public Health England I was promoted to a senior level and moved to working on a new
                        document
                        viewer plugin. This included developing a back end that could convert different document formats
                        into individual page images. During this project I also helped mentor developers as they
                        transitioned
                        from Classic ASP to C# .NET Core. Later I was part of a research project working to improve our
                        business intelligence products. We investigated using microservices on AWS that would be able to
                        take data from multiple sources and transform it into a data lake that would be compatible with
                        many

                        automate
